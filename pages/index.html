<p>my name's <b>oli!</b> this is a self-hosted portfolio for all my <small>(terrible)</small> work, i personally like the control and customisability that having
a personal website can bring, which is why you won't really find me on many major social platforms other than the ones i need (discord, youtube, etc)<br/><br/>
    
    enjoy your time here :3

<script>
    const hour = new Date().getHours(); // 0â€“23, based on local system time
    let partOfDay;

    if (hour < 12) {
        partOfDay = "morning";
    } 
    else {
        partOfDay = "evening";
    }

    const greetingEl = document.getElementById("greeting");
    greetingEl.textContent = greetingEl.textContent.replace("${partOfDay}", partOfDay);
</script>
