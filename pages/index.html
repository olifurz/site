    <p>my name's <b>oli</b> (or oliver!). this is a self-hosted portfolio for all my <small>(terrible)</small> work, i personally like the control and customisability that having
        a personal website can bring, which is why you won't really find me on many major social platforms other than the ones i need (discord, youtube, etc)<br/><br/>

        enjoy your time here
