    <h3>welcome</h3>
    <p style="padding-right: 160px;">
        hio! my name's oliver (or oli for short) and this is my personal website! you can find a variety of information about me on here, and
        stay up to date about what's going on in my life. the site itself has gone under a load of changes, i tend to treat it like a sandbox
        where i can test out new ideas and styles and see which works best for me!
    </p>

    <h4>site information</h4>
    <p>
        the site currently has been visited <b><span id="visitors"></span></b> times! <i>~ or maybe not! this code is buggy as shit and hasn't updated in ages, will fix soon xx</i>
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>what is the point of this site?</summary>
        this site is my little corner of the internet that i treat as sorta like an experimental art project! i like to use this to
        test a variety of different styles and designs, whilst also providing information about who i am. i feel like social media
        is very limiting in the amount of customisation you can have, you have a lot more possibilities with a website
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>when did you create this?</summary>
        i've had many different variations of my personal site in the past, olifurz.com in specific was created on the 29th of september 2025

    <details>
        <summary>what does "ai crawlers blocked" mean?</summary>
        generative ai crawlers (bots responsible for supplying information to chatgpt, copilot, etc) are strictly banned from accessing this site. i personally am against generative ai in most cases
        and don't enjoy the blatant copyright infringement that they inflict upon artists alike
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>who is this character i keep seeing?</summary>
        that's konata izumi! they're a character from the anime <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Star_(manga)">lucky star</a>, though i primarily see them as a mascot of the old web and myself as a person!
