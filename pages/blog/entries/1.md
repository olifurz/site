hi all! welcome to my first blog post of my new website! :3

this site is fully self-hosted from my proxmox cluster (x2 thinkcenter M700s), saves me having to rely on third 
party services for hosting & databases and alla that, whilst also letting me experiment with new technologies which'll
especially be helpful for the future.

i've refined my past websites many times as i've grown, jumping from color scheme to color scheme, layout to layout, trying
to find what's best, and to be honest i think i've found the perfect color palette & style with this one! it's based off
the <a href="https://catppuccin.com/palette/">catppuccin mocha</a> color palette, which my main desktop also utilises aswell.
the general style of my site is a mashup of a load of things, most notably
- **hyprland-styled tiling** for elements of the website. instead of having one big page we can just split it up into chunks
to make it easier on the eyes & less overwhelming
- **terminal interfaces**, this is most notable in all clickable links being surrounded by square brackets, and the monospace font
- **gtk app styling**, this one's hard to describe but i've always loved how they manage to cram in lots of info whilst keeping it unified & understandable (see gimp for example)

i hope you enjoy what i've created so far, more to come soon!!
