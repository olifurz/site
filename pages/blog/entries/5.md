happy new year! so sorry for the lack of blog posts, it's mostly cause i've been too busy with other projects and just never have
found the time nor motivation to work on posting more stuff for my blog.

i've decided to change directions entirely and go for a frutiger aero style for the website rather than a 90s windows style.
personally i find it really hard to work around such a complex palette and style on the site whilst also making sure it
looks good, as stuff like images tend to look a bit out of place! on the other hand the aero style is mostly just transparent
elements, so it can work with basically any background (in the current iteration as of right now you can see there's a multicoloured
animated background to demonstrate this)

please let me know what you think of this new style! i've also started focusing more at posting on bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/olifurz.com">@olifurz.com</a>),
if you use that platform it would be highly appreciated if you follow me on there
