merry christmas (or happy holidays) all!

a sitewide revamp is underway, as you can already see the layout's changed significantly from what it used to be. as a result of this i'll be tweaking the existing pages so they look good & aswell adding new ones

i wasn't really a fan of the current layout due to me not being able to expand the navbar without overcomplicating things, and it felt too modern for my liking aswell. i've decided to go for a more older 2000s style

i don't have a comments box or anything like that right now so uhh, if you have any suggestions or wanna leave your thoughts just <a href="/contact">contact me</a>
