        please do not contact me if you're looking for commission work or want to sell me something, i'm more than likely going to say no<br/>
        also, <b>if you are under the age of 13 do not contact me!</b> i'm not comfortable speaking with someone under that age
    </p>
    <h5>discord</h5>
    <p>
        i check my discord almost every day, send a friend request to <u>olifurz</u> and if your profile doesn't look suspicious i'll more than likely accept your friend request.
    </p>
    <h5>email</h5>
    <p>
        if you do not have access to discord, you may also contact me by emailing <a href="mailto:oli@olifurz.com">oli@olifurz.com</a>. keep in mind i won't respond as quickly!
